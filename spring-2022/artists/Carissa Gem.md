Hailing from BC's sunny interior, Carissa Gem grew up in the rave, and has been filling dance floors since before she was old enough to drive. Her sound is forward thinking and is constantly evolving. Drawing on influences from artists like Barisone, The Librarian, Mad Zach, and Danny Scrilla, you can expect her sets to be bass heavy with a healthy dose of rap.
â€¨These days you can find Carissa in Calgary, Alberta, where she has become a predominant figure in the bass music scene and is the host of What Will The Neighbours Think every Friday night on CJSW 90.9FM.

When she's not behind the decks, she spends her time swapping party planning tips and lending a hand to some of the best curators of Western Canada's deep soundscape culture.
