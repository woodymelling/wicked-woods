Growing up on a small island north of Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Aspen King always had a passion for electronic music. She’s been so immersed in music for a majority of her life, that she attended her first rave when she was a fetus in her mom’s womb. Growing up, she listened to music to the likes of: Bonobo, Jamie XX, Solomun, Claptone and The Gorillaz.

After moving to a smaller island with her family, where the population is 200 during the summer and drops down to 5 in the winter, she then started producing music with her abundant free time. Aspen studied electronic music production in Vancouver and has applied what she has learned into her productions with her own unique twist. Coming from a techno and house background, over the years she acquired an immense taste in electronic music and carved a sound for herself. Making her debut in 2018, Aspen has gained recognition in the music community performing at events on Vancouver Island. In 2021, she went on to have a debut set with Shambhala as part of their BC showcase, and then shortly after that performed live at their Amp Stage Reunion Event. She’s known for getting a crowd moving with her weird house style beats & deep bass that will keep you bumping all night.
