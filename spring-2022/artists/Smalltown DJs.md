The Smalltown DJs are a Canadian DJ/producer duo made up of Pete Emes and Mike Grimes. The sound of Smalltown DJs was born out of the ashes of old style hip-hop block parties, punk rock shows at community halls and the early nineties rave scene. Their sound has since evolved to garner attention and accolades from the far reaches of the globe with appearances at Lollapolooza, Fabric London, SXSW, Shambhala, Osheaga and more.
