Burchill was created out of a passion for electronic music & through his involvement in the Western Canadian music scene over the last six years. He has become a regular on the festival circuit & local favourite when it comes to delivering sets with selections from a wide range of genres: house, funk & bass. In recent years, Burchill has brought his sounds to the stages of FozzyFest, Motion Notion, Chasing Summer, Circle Carnival, Vibrant, IYS & Summer of Sound to name a few.

Pre-pandemic he built up his residency called Field Trip at The Hifi Club. His vision was aimed at bringing the West Coast festival energy into Calgaryâ€™s premier dance venue and showcasing the freshest and brightest talents in the industry. Rest assured, he is locked and loaded and ready to bring his unique offering to a stage near you.
