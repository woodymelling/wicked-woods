Whether Jake is writing music or designing a performance, he has one goal: to
transport listeners through a journey of various tempos, styles, and emotions of
entirely original music.

Over the last decade, Jake’s sound has evolved as he blends and expands on the
genres that inspire him. His deep understanding of the cultural roots of his
musical influences - namely drum and bass, jungle and footwork - is reflected in
the respect he gives to the genre’s past, even as he shapes its future sounds. As
a producer, Jake’s work incorporates uplifting melodies, dynamic soundscapes
and strong, progressive songwriting.
Jake has released music on RAM Records ProgRam imprint, Aufect, Muti Music,
High Tea, Really Good, Machinist Music, and Adapted. In his nonstop pursuit of
new material for his live shows and to grow his skills, Jake can almost always be
found in the studio. When he’s not writing new music, you can find Jake Robertz
teaching music production at Night Vision Music Academy in Edmonton.
