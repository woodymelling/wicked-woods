Naturalist is made up of two music lovin' brothers, Sam Moffat and Caleb Brown from Fernie BC.

These brothers are known for bringing good vibes. Their fun and energetic stage presence will make you want to dance just as much as their music does. They each bringing a unique style to the turntables and their live sets are made up of various styles of deep house and disco bangers that come together to create a sound they call ‘Space Disco.’

2019 has been their breakthrough year and after winning the Kootenay Music Awards ‘Artist Of The Year’ they shared their sound to the largest crowd they have ever played for at The Living Room Stage at Shambhala.

The future looks bright for these boys, and they are ready to run with it.
