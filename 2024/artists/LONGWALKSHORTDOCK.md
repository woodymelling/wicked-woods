Longwalkshortdock essentially started the first time Dave King heard gritty electronic music in early eighties video games. Strongly influenced by these sounds and melodies, Dave started recording and looping segments of this material and experimenting with effects and sound editing as a child. Currently, a veteran of sound design, electronic music production and Live PA performance for well over 2 decades, Longwalkshortdock's music has stepped into a genre of its own. Strongly influences by vintage analog synthesis, film and video games scores, virtually all genres of music in addition to new technologies, LWSD stacks layers of melody in his tracks until they implode and reform. For his live performances, driving drums and morphing synth lines join forces with rolling grooves and melodic lead lines to create a wide variety of dance floor friendly originals. While he may be best known by the festival crowd as a not-to-miss act for his spirited antics and bass-heavy dance music, Longwalkshortdock’s productions crosses into many territories. His vast catalogue of hundreds of compositions dives into everything from Ambient, IDM, Electro, Drum and Bass, Dubstep, Halftime, Techno, Left Field Bass, Electronica, Down tempo and Film Score work. Dave holds two degrees from the Art Institute of Burnaby for Music Recording and Production and has been continuing to improve and hone his skills since he made music his full time occupation in 2005. An ongoing resident artist at top-tier festivals such as Shambhala, Bass Coast, Electric Love and Wicked Woods, LWSD has made a name for himself putting on extremely energetic, yet personal and emotionally engaging live shows all over North America. His performances are live in every sense of the word, with Dave manning his own synthesizers, drum machines, samplers, vocals, effects, computers and lighting. In the studio LWSD is always looking to blend the old and the new combining cutting edge digital technology with his passion for the lush character and sound of vintage analog gear. Just ask him about his synth collection. With four albums and dozens of other collaborations, remixes and one-off releases to his name—not to mention countless gigs at festivals, bars and other venues across North American and beyond, Longwalkshortdock is one of the hardest-working and creative people in the electronic music scene. His raw, high energy performances and openness with his fans have created an almost cult-like following. This mix of unique performance talent and authenticity make Longwalkshortdock a one-of-a-kind artist—as anyone who has seen him play or even shaken his hand will attest.
