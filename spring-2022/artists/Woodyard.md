Often referred to as a “Human Jukebox”, Woodyard’s knowledge of music spans effortlessly across eras and genres. A multi-talented musician who uses looping machines, his voice and guitar, Woodyard is best known for his wide array of genre-bending covers that showcase his vocal range and eclectic sound creating truly unique and dance-inspiring performances. With no two shows sounding the same, Woodyard’s improv-esque style is reminiscent of a Reggie Watts and Marc Rebillet lovechild - a multi-instrumentalist who captivates audiences and sparks dancefloors seconds after taking to the stage.

Born and raised in North Vancouver, Mark Woodyard is no rookie to the live music scene having played live for the better part of the last two decades reaching some of the worlds most unique festival stages including BassCoast, Shambhala, and Envision, as well as becoming a mainstay at private events frequently requested by some of the countries most iconic brands.
