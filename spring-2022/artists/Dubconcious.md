Dubconscious has come to represent both the east and the western coast of Canada. Born
in Toronto and raised on the jungle / drum’n’bass sounds permeating the city in the late
90s & early 2000s, he developed a taste for hard beats drenched in reggae vibes. 2004
brought a big move across the country to the city of Victoria, which was nurturing a
fledgling breaks and jungle scene – by the end of his first year of University, he had bought
his first set of Technics and the seed was planted. Bouncing back and forth between
Toronto and Victoria for the next three years of school presented plenty of opportunities to
play different music to new crowds, adding reggae & dancehall to his repertoire, as well
dubstep – in its infancy at this point. After school the move was made back east, joining up
with the Dubslingers crew in Toronto, while they were holding down Canada’s longest
running dubstep weekly - Dubslingers Wednesdays at Thymeless.

Having established a name for himself in Toronto’s competitive scene, he headed west once
more, this time settling in Nelson, BC. After spending two productive years in the area
immersing himself in both the great outdoors & the underground party scene, he moved
further west to Vancouver, where he played all across the board - dropping sets jam packed
with a mash of many forms of urban & modern bass music at a wide selection of venues
across the city, the province, and the country on a regular basis. Most recently he's found
himself back in Nelson BC, at first working closely with Shambhala and Bloom Nightclub - but
more recently focusing on his own musical endeavours.

Appearing in nearly every major city in Canada, and sharing the stage with a wide and varied
spectrum of headliners - from Beenie Man and Barrington Levy, to Andy C, Shy FX and Dillinja to
The Roots, Mixmaster Mike and Blockhead, to Gramatik , Dub FX, Glitch Mob and Beats Antique,
to Bicep and Kastle, to Salva, Clicks & Whistles and the Gaslamp Killer to Truth, Plastician and
Rusko - he's proven his versatility many times over, across an array of arenas. He's also appeared
at numerous music festivals including BC's Shambhala (10x), Bass Coast (4x), Diversity, Motion
Notion, FozzyFest, Wicked Woods and the Victoria Ska Fest three times over - as well as
Ontario's WEMF and Harvest Festivals, and even the Dragon Festival in Granada, Spain. He
curated a Sunday night weekly at The Keefer Bar in Vancouver for 3.5 years, and was also
running an all-vinyl reggae & dancehall weekly for a time - Wax Wednesdays at the Waldorf - the
poster for which was featured in Major Lazer & Busy Signal's music video for "Bumaye."
