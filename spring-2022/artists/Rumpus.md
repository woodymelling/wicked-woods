Rumpus, by definition, does in fact bring the noise – and the bodies – to dancefloors and music festivals around the globe. A badass drummer with a punk-rock upbringing, Rumpus infuses that alternative edge into his own unique brand of high vibe, bass heavy, funky house music.

Powered by live drums and one-of-a-kind productions, Rumpus’s eclectic style has been flexing speakers on an international scale, with recent appearances at major festivals including Shambhala, Burning Man, Lightning in a Bottle and Shipsomnia in Ibiza. His visually captivating, high-energy live shows are favourites among freaky festival folk and are even known to turn electronic music’s skeptics into fast fans. 


His releases include music on Insomniac Records, Club Sweat, Vibrancy, Westwood Recordings & Mixfeed, as well as recent collaborations with Volac, Smalltown DJs, Dread MC, Kid Enigma, Ill Phil and Neon Steve. His music has gained play and support from artists including Tiësto, Marten Horger, Marshmello, Oliver Heldens & Nicky Romero to name a few.

A feature in DJ Mag where Rumpus was named one of “12 Emerging Acts to hear this September“, receiving the award for Sask Music 2020 Electronic Artist Of The Year, and also a nomination for the 2020 Western Canadian Music Awards ‘Dance Artist of the Year’,  shows the continued acceleration for this eclectic producer, drummer and DJ and is proving this Rumpus is just getting started!
