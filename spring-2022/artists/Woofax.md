For over a decade, WOOFAX was the major musical creative force behind the electronic music groups Terravita and Hot Pink Delorean. His original music and involved projects have been licensed to entertainment on networks such as FOX, MTV, CBS, Netflix and more. He has written, engineered and consulted dozens of hit electronic tracks in various genres. Under his pseudonym Tremourz, he released charting hit singles including the North American dubstep anthem, “Sexy Party” with J Rabbit and his own Terravita remix of the same song.
Woofax came swinging out of the gate, with his release "Spoiler Alert" charting #1 for weeks on the Beatport Glitch hop charts. His music was quickly picked up by several labels such as Circus Records, Dim mak, Impossible Records, Jungle Cakes, PLAY ME, Sleeveless Records and Westwood Recordings.

In 2020, his focus shifted to his own label, WOOFAX MUSIC, created exclusively to release his own evolving aesthetic of electronic bass music. Paired with his label is the WOOFAX RADIO PODCAST, a self-hosted show that premieres new tracks from the label and provides fresh tastemaking to the electronic bass music landscape.
As well as being an international electronic writer,producer and performer, Woofax is also a celebrated mixing and mastering engineer. His diverse list of clients includes Firepower records, The Funk Hunter's Westwood recordings, and the GRAMMY award winning artists The Crystal Method. He helped engineer many songs from the beginning of Dillon Francis’ career and consulted and assisted mastering on Excision “Codename X” album. He continues to work with Protohype's label, Underdog records. On top of all that he works closely with the internationally acclaimed loudspeaker company PK Sound.
WOOFAX is here to bring awesome music of all sorts to old and new friends alike with skills, style and energy. This lifelong electronic music architect invites you to join the party!
