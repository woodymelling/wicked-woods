Manteasah's sound resonates between a moon-lit forest and a dark city skyline.

Their artistry is rooted in Kelowna BC, tastefully curating electronic downtempo mixed with hip-hop and a dusting of soul.
When elements of Makemdefâ€™s clever word play and intricate production meets the sister's dynamic harmonies and heavy-hitting instrumentation, the perfect storm of dark atmospheric textures is transported by the mysterious trio.
