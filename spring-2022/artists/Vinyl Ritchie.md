The 45 RPM funk-master, a pioneer of precise pitch control, the grandaddy of the west coast DJ scene – Vinyl Ritchie – blessed The Living Room Stage on Friday night this year between Czech and Max Ulis, with this widely varied, yet totally cohesive and wildly clever genre-hopping two-hour set. Mixing between Aerosmith and Wu-Tang with complete ease, dropping chunky techno and latin-influenced house beats amongst classic rap, metal and pop, offering quick-witted commentary throughout – this is Vinyl Ritchie at his best.
